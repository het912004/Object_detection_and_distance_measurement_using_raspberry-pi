# Object-detection-distance-measurement-using-raspberry-pi

📌 Project Overview :-

This project involves the development of a smart embedded system capable of detecting multiple objects such as human presence, cell phones, computer monitors, and keyboards, along with estimating their approximate distance from the system.

The detected objects and their corresponding distances are displayed in real-time on a 16×2 LCD display, providing a compact and efficient way to monitor surroundings in embedded or IoT applications.


🛠 Tools & Technologies Used :-

Raspberry Pi, 8MP Camera, Ultrasonic Sensor, 16*2 LCD Display, Thonny IDE (Python).


🔍 Key Features :-

1) Real-time object detection using Raspberry Pi and camera

2) Distance measurement using ultrasonic sensing

3) LCD display integration for live distance feedback

4) Ideal for smart workspace monitoring, automation, or IoT projects
