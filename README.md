# Object-detection-distance-measurement-using-raspberry-pi

üì° Object Detection and Distance Estimation System :-

This project involves the development of a smart embedded system capable of detecting multiple objects such as human presence, cell phones, computer monitors, and keyboards, along with estimating their approximate distance from the system.

The system uses a camera with OpenCV (Python) for real-time object detection and an ultrasonic sensor to estimate the distance of the nearest object. The detected object names and distances are displayed live on a 16√ó2 LCD display, making it useful for various embedded and IoT-based applications.


üõ† Tools & Technologies Used :-

Raspberry Pi, 8MP Camera Module, OpenCV Library (Python), Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), 16√ó2 LCD Display, Thonny IDE (Python).


üîç Key Features

1) Real-time object detection using OpenCV on Raspberry Pi

2) Detection of common objects: human, monitor, phone, keyboard

3) Approximate distance measurement using ultrasonic sensor

4) Live distance shown on a 16√ó2 LCD display
   

üåê Real-World Applications :-

1) Home Automation & Security:- Identifies presence of people or objects for activating lights, sending alerts, or recording.

2) Energy-Efficient Smart Devices:- Turns off devices when no human/object is detected, reducing unnecessary energy use.

3) Basic Robotics Applications:- Enables simple robots to recognize and react to obstacles or targets.
